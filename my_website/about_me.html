  <p1> Hi Everyone! Thanks for visiting my webpage. <br> My name is Derek! 
  I am extremely passionate about teaching and finding <br> new, innovative ways to
  teach the same things! I also commute to school on my bike. <br> This past year I 
  rode to school 159 days! Each day I covered about 9 miles, <br> I'll let 
  you do the math to figure out how many miles I covered last year! 
  </p1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p2>A little bit more about me is that I have been married <br>
  for almost 3 years (my wife is a teacher too). <br> I also enjoy
  playing basketball and golf in my free time. <br>
  I enjoy watching all sports, especially football (GO Packers!).<br>
  </p2>

  <p3> Thank you for reading my page! </p3>
